As any kind of user on the system
I can visit the items catalog ("/items")
I see all items in the system except disabled items
Each item will display the following information:
- the name of the item
- a small thumbnail image for the item
- the merchant name who sells the item
- how many of the item the merchant has in stock
- the merchant's current price for the item
Each item's name and thumbnail image are links to that item's show page
