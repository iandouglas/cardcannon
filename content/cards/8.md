As a visitor
When I visit the user registration page
If I fill out the registration form
But include an email address already in the system
Then I am returned to the registration page
My details are not saved and I am not logged in
The form is filled in with all previous data except the email field and password fields
I see a flash message telling me the email address is already in use
