As an admin user
When I visit a user's profile page ("/admin/users/5")
I see a link to "upgrade" the user's account to become a merchant
When I click on that link
I am redirected to ("/admin/merchants/5") because the user is now a merchant
And I see a flash message indicating the user has been upgraded
The next time this user logs in they are now a merchant
Only admins can see the "upgrade" link
Only admins can reach any route necessary to upgrade the user to merchant status
