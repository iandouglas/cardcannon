```
As a visitor or registered user
When I have added items to my cart
And I visit my cart ("/cart")
I see all items I've added to my cart
And I see a link to empty my cart
Each item in my cart shows the following information:
- the name of the item
- a very small thumbnail image of the item
- the merchant I'm buying this item from
- the price of the item
- my desired quantity of the item
- a subtotal (price multiplied by quantity)
I also see a grand total of what everything in my cart will cost
