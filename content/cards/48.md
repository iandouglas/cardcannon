```
As a merchant
When I visit my dashboard ("/dashboard")
If any users have pending orders containing items I sell
Then I see a list of these orders.
Each order listed includes the following information:
- the ID of the order, which is a link to the order show page ("/dashboard/orders/15")
- the date the order was made
- the total quantity of my items in the order
- the total value of my items for that order
