When I visit an order's show page
If the order is still "pending", I see a button or link to cancel the order
When I click the cancel button for an order, the following happens:
- Each row in the "order items" table is given a status of "unfulfilled"
- The order itself is given a status of "cancelled"
- Any item quantities in the order that were previously fulfilled have their quantities returned to their respective merchant's inventory for that item.
- I am returned to my profile page
- I see a flash message telling me the order is now cancelled
- And I see that this order now has an updated status of "cancelled"
