As a registered user
When I visit my profile page
And I click on a link for order's show page
My URL route is now something like "/profile/orders/15"
I see all information about the order, including the following information:
- the ID of the order
- the date the order was made
- the date the order was last updated
- the current status of the order
- each item I ordered, including name, description, thumbnail, quantity, price and subtotal
- the total quantity of items in the whole order
- the grand total of all items for that order
