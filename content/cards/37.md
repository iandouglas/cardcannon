```
As a visitor or registered user
When I have items in my cart
And I visit my cart
Next to each item in my cart
I see a button or link to remove that item from my cart
- clicking this button will remove the item but not other items
I see a button or link to increment the count of items I want to purchase
- I cannot increment the count beyond the merchant's inventory size
I see a button or link to decrement the count of items I want to purchase
- If I decrement the count to 0 the item is immediately removed from my cart
