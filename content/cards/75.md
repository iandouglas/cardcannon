```
As an admin user
When I click on the "Users" link in the nav
Then my current URI route is "/admin/users"
And I see all users in the system who are not merchants nor admins
Each user's name is a link to a show page for that user ("/admin/users/5")
Next to each user's name is the date they registered
I see a "disable" button next to any users who are not yet disabled
I see an "enable" button next to any users whose accounts are disabled
