As an admin merchant
When I visit the merchant index page
And I click on a "disable" button for an enabled merchant
I am returned to the admin's merchant index page
And I see a flash message that the merchant's account is now disabled
And I see that the merchant's account is now disabled
This merchant cannot log in
