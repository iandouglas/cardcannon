```
As a registered user, merchant, or admin
When I visit the login path
If I am a regular user, I am redirected to my profile page
If I am a merchant user, I am redirected to my merchant dashboard page
If I am an admin user, I am redirected to the home page of the site
And I see a flash message that tells me I am already logged in
