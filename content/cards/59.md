As an admin user
When I visit a merchant's dashboard ("/admin/merchants/6")
I see a link to "downgrade" the merchant's account to become a regular user
The merchant themselves do NOT see this link
When I click on that link
I am redirected to ("/admin/users/6") because the merchant is now a regular user
And I see a flash message indicating the user has been downgraded
The next time this user logs in they are no longer a merchant
Only admins can see the "downgrade" button
Only admins can reach any route necessary to downgrade the merchant to user status
