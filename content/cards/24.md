As a registered user
When I visit my profile page
If my account has ordered items
I see every order I've made, which includes the following information:
- the ID of the order, which is a link to the order show page
- the date the order was made
- the date the order was last updated
- the current status of the order
- the total quantity of items in the order
- the grand total of all items for that order
