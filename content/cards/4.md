### Move an Issue to In Progress from A Branch
 
WaffleBot automates updates to your Waffle board for you so that your team stays aligned.

Now you're going to learn how to move an issue into In Progress on your Waffle board when you create a branch.  When you include an issue number in your branch name and push the branch to GitHub, WaffleBot automatically moves the issue to In Progress and assigns you to the issue.

Things to do:  

- [ ] Create a new file in this repo and commit it to a new branch.  
- [ ] Name your branch `thisIssueNumber-whatever-you-want`.  
- [ ] Push the branch to GitHub.  
- [ ] Watch your Waffle board to see what happens.

The issue should have moved to In Progress and should be assigned to you.
