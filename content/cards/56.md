As a visitor
When I visit the merchants index page, I see an area with statistics:
- top 3 merchants who have sold the most by price and quantity
- top 3 merchants who were fastest at fulfilling items in an order
- worst 3 merchants who were slowest at fulfilling items in an order
- top 3 states where any orders were shipped
- top 3 cities where any orders were shipped (Springfield, MI should not be grouped with Springfield, CO)
- top 3 biggest orders by quantity of items
