As a visitor
I see a navigation bar
This navigation bar includes links for the following:
- a link to return to the welcome / home page of the application ("/")
- a link to browse all items for sale ("/items")
- a link to see all merchants ("/merchants")
- a link to my shopping cart ("/cart")
- a link to log in ("/login")
- a link to the user registration page ("/register")
Next to the shopping cart link I see a count of the items in my cart
