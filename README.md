# ðŸ—‚ Wafffle.io Card Cannon
A GitHub App for bootstrapping a Waffle.io board with issues.

Useful for educators to easily create Waffle.io boards prepopulated with cards, labels, epics, and dependencies for curriculum.

## How It Works

The GitHub App listens for `issue.opened` webhook events and creates new issues based on the [/cards/...](./cards/) config directory of this project.

## Usage

1. Ensure the Card Cannon app is running.  See [Installation](#Installation) below.
2. Create a new GitHub repo if needed.
3. Create a new Waffle.io project and board if needed.
4. Install the GitHub App in the desired repo from https://github.com/settings/apps/your-app-name/installations.

5. From your Waffle.io board, create a new issue titled `bootstrap my board`.
