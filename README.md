# cardcannon
A GitHub App for bootstrapping a Waffle.io board with issues.

Useful for educators to easily create Waffle.io boards prepopulated with cards, labels, epics, and dependencies for curriculum.

## How It Works

The GitHub App listens for `issue.opened` webhook events and creates new issues based on the (/cards/)[./cards/] config data in this project.
